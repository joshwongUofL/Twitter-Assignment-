  			<h1>Space Agencies</h1>
  			<p>Here are a list of space agencies that builds their own orbital rockets. Each of them also have resources to provide launch services.<br>Each have either achieved spaceflight or interplanetary mission, built their own satellites or scientific payloads.</p>

  			<h2>European Space Agency</h2>
  			<p>"ESA is known for its expertise in international and inter-agency cooperation. On the one hand, it means their own hardware seems to take forever to build. Their flagship Ariane 5 rocket was years late in development. Most new rockets are, of course. I've been hearing promises about the Ariane 6 for the better part of twenty years and just saw a new article saying it really will be completed “soon”, and now it will be (partly) reusable, thanks to SpaceX shaming them with the relaunch of its recovered Falcon 9. On the other hand, I personally credit the “International” aspect of the ISS largely to ESA’s cooperation, and its ability to facilitate cooperation with other agencies too. Masterful diplomacy doesn't facilitate swift engineering, but it might save the world. And help spread more widely the wealth of space operations expertise."</p>

 			<h2>Chinese National Space Agency</h2>
 			<p>"CNSA is known for building its own human space flight program without help from the Americans or the Russians. Except that they did get help from the Russians. Still, only three of the Big Six can send humans into orbit without cooperating with any other agency (CNSA, Roscosmos, and NASA… except, right now, not NASA either). So that's a big deal."</p>

  			<h2>Japanese Space Agency</h2>
  			<p>"JAXA is known for being sadly overlooked, even though they have all the stuff that ought to impress everyone, and does impress industry insiders. They just seem… competent without ever making headlines, I suppose. With the industry-wide challenge to embrace reusability and lower launch costs, JAXA has a fresh opportunity to distinguish itself, but I'm not aware of any plans to do so. The media may just be overlooking them, though…"</p>

			<h2>Indian Space Research Organization</h2>
			<p>"ISRO is known for shocking the rest of the world with brilliant accomplishments on a Spartan budget: successfully sending a probe (of their own design and manufacture) to Mars (on their own rocket) on their very first attempt, and successfully testing a scaled prototype of their own space shuttle. Among many other more modest but significant successes of course, but those two in particular have cemented their status as one of the premier space agencies in the world."</p>

 			<h2>Roscosmos</h2>
 			<p>"Roscosmos is known for dominating the first two thirds of the Space Race of the 1950s and 60s, and for their no-frills reliability in human spaceflight. Right now they are the only human space flight provider to the international community, in fact. Their cosmonauts have more space station experience than anyone else: while NASA kept working away at the Shuttle program, Roscosmos launched half a dozen space stations: that's an expertise that will give them an advantage in the future, despite the apparent technology gap."</p>

 			<h2>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</h2>
 			<p>"NASA is known for constantly wanting to be on the cutting edge of technology and also of mission planning. They sent the first (and so far the only) humans to the Moon; they hold the records for first probes to visit all the outer planets and even Pluto, though they welcome international partnership on all their missions. NASA’s JPL is the grand master of interplanetary communication, telemetry, and travel, and routinely cooperates with other space agencies to track and communicate with space probes that have left our immediate cislunar neighborhood."</p>

 			<h2>Space Exploration Technologies Corp.</h2>
 			<p>SpaceX is one of the few private aerospace companies that have come so far in recent times.</p>
 			<p>"Space Exploration Technologies Corp., doing business as SpaceX, is a private American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by entrepreneur Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and enabling the colonization of Mars. SpaceX has since developed the Falcon launch vehicle family and the Dragon spacecraft family, which both currently deliver payloads into Earth orbit."</p>

 			<h2>NASA vs SpaceX</h2>
 			<p>"SpaceX, the upstart company, and NASA, the government agency, both have plans to venture to Mars and orbit the moon. But that doesn’t mean they’ve launched a new space race. In fact, NASA has long been SpaceX's most important customer, providing contracts to deliver cargo and eventually astronauts to the International Space Station. And the Hawthorne company will need NASA's technical support to achieve the first of its grand ambitions in deep space.SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk acknowledged as much last week, shortly after announcing that SpaceX would launch two private, paying individuals on a weeklong lunar flyby in 2018.</p>
 			<p>"SpaceX could not do this without NASA," Musk tweeted. "Can't express enough appreciation.""</p>
